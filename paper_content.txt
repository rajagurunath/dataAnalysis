The Internet Management Standards defines a network
management framework for TCP/IP-based internets [3].
The framework includes the simple network management
protocol (SNMP), a structure of management information,
and a management information base (MIB). The
organization model of the SNMP clusters all active
entities in the network in two types: Network
Management Stations (NMS) and agents. In Internet the
details of objects, reflecting the static and dynamic states
of managed resources, are stored in a logical database
known as the MIB. This management information can be
accessed via SNMP and is available at each manager and
agent node. To maintain a sufficiently accurate view of
the network, the NMS may need to poll agents frequently
for different network statistics. The agents are simple
software processes that live on every managed node,
collecting, forwarding and setting MIB entries, either at
predefined intervals or when requested to by the NMS.
The NMS and SNMP agents communicate using the
SNMP communication capabilities.
With the increasing amount of information that SNMP
agents maintain (could be as much as 500 MIB entries),
the bandwidth and computation time consumed during
transfer and processing of such bulky data is a concern.

(2.6. Detection of Intermittent Faults
In the case of intermittent faults, once it is observed that an intermittent fault has occurred in a node,
 the node starts noticing the fault for a length of time until it reappears again; this length of time 
 is called the fault appearance duration (FAD). The errors that reappear due to permanent faults or 
 correlated intermittent faults reappear after what is called the fault disappearance duration (FDD) 
 (see Figure 6). Intermittent faults are further categorised by considering their measurements, and 
then estimating their disappearance and reappearance at discrete time intervals, such as kT 
for kT = 1, 2, â€¦, kmax (see
